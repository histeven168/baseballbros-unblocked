Every at-bat is a mini challenge: read velocity, pick a spot, and commit. Nail the window and you’ll hear the satisfying crack of the bat as the ball explodes into the outfield or clears the fence. Miss by a hair and you’ll foul it back or roll over — the feedback is immediate and fair, so improvement feels natural.
